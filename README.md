<!-- # Portfolio.Clean -->
### _Work in Progress_

> **NOTE**
> Currently learning the cleaning architecture design philosophy, I decided to renew my portfolio in order to put my new knowledge into pratice.
>
> As Confucius said _"Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated."_...And he was probably right.
> Indeed, creating a simple web application such as a portfolio using clean architecture mays seem more time consuming than useful, and I totally agree.
>
> However this design comes with many advantages, and praticing on small projects at first can be really helpful is you want to tackle bigger projects in the future !
>
> So feel free to use my code as you wish !!
